# Dual N‑Back Extreme

Dual N‑Back Extreme is a cognitive training app designed to boost your working memory by challenging you to recall items from a set number of steps back.

For example, in a **2‑back** session you must remember the stimulus that appeared two rounds earlier.

## How It Works

1. **Observe the Cues**  
   Watch the flashing cells and listen carefully to the sounds played in each trial.

2. **Remember & Compare**  
   Keep in mind both the position and the sound from previous trials.

3. **Respond Appropriately**  
   When the current cell or sound matches the one from _N_ steps back, press the corresponding button to record your response.
